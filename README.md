## Tim Cole

An ex-music producer putting down the synthesizers to search for dynamic team-based problem solving activities without the need to autotune anyone. 

For the past 9 years I've been a full-time producer, mostly for a two-man band [(The Correspondents)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABS-mlep5rY). With which I've toured the world, received millions of youtube views and collaborated across multiple projects from album releases with international marketing and PR campaigns, to ensemble theatrical productions.

After completing the Makers Academy bootcamp I'm now looking for a junior developer front-end or full-stack role in an organisation where I can continue to learn and make little machines with words, get far too excited about passing tests and air punch after solving a bug.

__Tech Skills__: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including ES6), React,  Redux, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

__Behavioural Skills__: TDD, Agile, pair programming, XP, code reviews

## Projects
For a complete list, see my [Github](https://github.com/Timdavidcole).

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Meet In The Midl](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/meet-in-the-middle-react-front-end) | Our final project at Makers, a fair and equal way of working out where to meet a friend (in London).  We had two weeks, and just about got it working!  We opted for a React single page app, with a fairly light Rails API back end.  Main difficulties were making the stack far too top heavy, putting 3rd party API calls in the front-end, and not having enough time to test the algorithm for edge cases. | Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Cypress, Jest, Rspec |
| [Village Green](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/village-green-backend-api) | This is a work in progress, and my first fully personal project from concept to design to deployment. I've now finished the rudimentary backend API.  All Node.js & Express and deployed on Heroku (working on AWS). Then I'll start building the front-end soon in React & Redux.  The basic idea is an online parish/community noticeboard based on location, where users can only post to their home address.  | Javscript, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, AWS |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/riannemcc/acebook-RVs)| This full-stack Facebook clone was our introductuction to group-based projects from scratch. We had to use Rails, which took some getting used to, but overall we were really happy with what we put together in the time frame, from sticking to Agile principles to version control to our presentation to all the other groups. | Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Selenium-Webdriver, Rubocop, Simplecov, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/Chitter-frontend-api-challenge) | A Twitter clone that I decided to make my first fourr√©e into single page React land. The back-end API was provided to us by Makers so another pure Front-End project.  I really enjoyed working with React, and once I got my head around components/props/state really enjoyed how powerful the framework is. | React, CSS |

Also a few classic tech-tests for good measure [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/gilded-rose), [Bank Test](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/bank-tech-test).

## Skills

##### Intuitive
- Music production required me to be fully on top of the latest technologies and quickly learn new instruments as situations required. I had to teach myself how to use everything from ancient mixing consoles to live video DJing software to a professional level extremely quickly.

##### Attention To Detail
- During my time at Universal Music an extremely methodical approach was needed to ensure legal copy was correct for multi-CD compliations.  The difference between good and great sounding music is very much in the details.

##### Empathetic
- While I was the musical director for Fear & Delight: The Show I had to create new bespoke soundtracks for established acrobats, who often had been (safetly) performing to the same music for years.  Plenty of diplomacy was needed to convert them to my new creations!  I also had to regularly run bands for live performances, organising rehearsals and writing parts for musicians. 

##### Self-Starter
- Nothing happens in music unless you make it happen.  Organising tours/recording schedules/bookkeeping was the day-to-day experience. I also started the first ever Electro Swing club night in Leeds during university.
