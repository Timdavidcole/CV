## Tim Cole

An ex-music producer putting down the synthesizers to search for dynamic team-based problem solving activities without the need to autotune anyone. 

For the past 9 years I've been a full-time producer, mostly for a two-man band [(The Correspondents)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABS-mlep5rY). With which I've toured the world, received millions of youtube views and collaborated across multiple projects from album releases with international marketing and PR campaigns, to ensemble theatrical productions.

Tech is often at the forefront of contemporary music, but after discovering how building little machines with words to solve the world's problems felt like magic; the chance to do that day-in day-out with other like minded people sounded like an exciting new career to me.

I'm looking for a junior developer front-end or full-stack role in an organisation where I can continue to learn, socialize and find elegant solutions to contemporary problems.

__Tech Skills__: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including ES6), React,  Redux, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

__Behavioural Skills__: XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews

## Projects
For a complete list, see my [Github](https://github.com/Timdavidcole).

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Final Project](https://www.bbc.co.uk) | TBA | TBA |
| [Personal Project](https://www.bbc.co.uk) | TBA | TBA |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/riannemcc/acebook-RVs)| This full-stack Facebook clone was our introductuction to group-based projects from scratch. We had to use Rails, which took some getting used to, but overall we were really happy with what we put together in the time frame, from sticking to Agile principles to version control to our presentation to all the other groups. | Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Selenium-Webdriver, Rubocop, Simplecov, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/Chitter-frontend-api-challenge) | A Twitter clone that I decided to make my first fourr√©e into React. The back-end API was provided to us by Makers so another pure Front-End project.  I really enjoyed working with React, and once I got my head around components/props/state really enjoyed how powerful the framework is. | React, CSS |
| [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/bowling-challenge) | This was my first javascript/jQuery front-end project, a simple bowling scoredboard. I really enjoyed making this and it sowed my love for front-end. | Javascript, Jasmine, jQuery, Ruby, Sinatra |

Also a few tech-tests for good measure [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/guilded-rose), [Bank Test](https://github.com/Timdavidcole/bank-tech-test).

## Skills

##### Intuitive
- Picking up new concepts quickly is key to keeping projects fresh and contemporary, whether technological or musical, this was a large part of my job, and one of the most rewarding.  Development is no different, and diving into a new framework/language/technology is incredibly rewarding.

##### Project Focused
- Music is a blank canvas, with endless possibilities. So divining discrete objectives and knowing when to finalise, whether in the studio or the meeting room, was a large part of my job.  I took pride in directing ambitions, reading the market and building campaigns.

##### Attention To Detail
- Ensuring our finished projects were actually finished was the most challenging part of the job, and driving quality control through tight budgets and deadlines is what separated a good album, from a great album.

##### Calm Communicator
- Sleep deprived soundmen, prima donna acrobats and neurotic managers are just some of the types of people you need to keep on side and motivated as a music producer.  Keeping your cool in stressful creative environments, while being open to all opinions I found always brought out the best in people. 

##### Self-Starter
- Nothing happens in music unless you make it happen.  Organising tours/recording schedules/bookkeeping was the day-to-day experience.
