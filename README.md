## Tim Cole

An ex-music producer putting down the synthesisers to search for dynamic team-based problem solving activities without the need to autotune anyone. For the past 12 years I've been a full-time producer for mostly one band [(The Correspondents)](https://www.thecorrespondents.co.uk/), with which I've toured the world, recieved millions of youtube views and collaborated across multiple projects from album releases with international marketing and PR campaigns, to ensemble theatrical productions. Tech is often at the forefront of contemporary music, but after discovering how building little machines with words to solve the world's problems felt like magic; the chance to do that day-in day-out with other like minded people sounded like a career to me.

## Skills

##### Intuitive
- Picking up new concepts quickly is key to keeping projects fresh and contemporary, whether technological or musical, this was a large part of my job, and one of the most rewarding.

##### Project Focused
- Music is a blank canvas, with endless possiblities. So divining discrete objectives, whether in the studio or the meeting room, was a large part of my job.  I took pride in directing ambitions, reading the market and building campaigns.

##### Calm communicator
- Sleep driven musicians, prima donna acrobats and neurotic managers are just a few of the types of people you need to keep on side and motivated as a music producer.  Keeping your cool in stressful creative environments, while being open to all opinions always brought out the best in people. 

##### Grade 3 recorder 
- I'm yet to find a situation this isn't useful in.
