## Tim Cole

An ex-music producer putting down the synthesizers to search for dynamic team-based problem solving activities without the need to autotune anyone. 

For the past 9 years I've been a full-time producer, mostly for a two-man band [(The Correspondents)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABS-mlep5rY). With which I've toured the world, received millions of youtube views and collaborated across multiple projects from album releases with international marketing and PR campaigns, to ensemble theatrical productions.

Tech is often at the forefront of contemporary music, but after discovering how building little machines with words to solve the world's problems felt like magic; the chance to do that day-in day-out with other like minded people sounded like an exciting new career to me.

I'm looking for a junior developer front-end or full-stack role in an organisation where I can continue to learn, socialize and find elegant solutions to contemporary problems.

__Tech Skills__: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including ES6), React,  Redux, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

__Behavioural Skills__: XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews

## Projects
For a complete list, see my [Github](https://github.com/Timdavidcole).

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Final Project](https://www.bbc.co.uk) | This was my final project at Makers Academy. A full-stack bee-tracking iOS app with a [Rails backend API](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/beeAppy_api) which I built myself and deployed to [Heroku](https://bee-appy.herokuapp.com/bees) and a React-Native front-end.
| [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/gilded-rose-ruby) | I spent two days on this classic kata, refactoring a hideous mess of nested if/else conditionals to use duck typing and inheritance. | Ruby, RSpec |
| [Instagram](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/instagram-challeng) | A weekend challenge to build an Instagram clone.  I used Chrome DevTools to inspect and copy the styling from Instagram.  | Ruby/Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres, Devise, Paperclip |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/acebook)| Made by the whole team of 17 programmers from 5 countries working in 3 time zones during week 8 (Rails week) of the Makers Course.  I built much of the front end and also worked on building a polymorphic comment feature.  | Ruby, Sinatra, bcrypt, DataMapper, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/chitter-challenge) | An Twitter clone made over a weekend after one month on the Makers course.  As Sinatra is less automated than Rails, I manually created all the user authentication features using bcrypt.  I used partials for the views and refactored the controller logic to separate files. | Ruby/Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, bcrypt |

## Skills

##### Intuitive
- Picking up new concepts quickly is key to keeping projects fresh and contemporary, whether technological or musical, this was a large part of my job, and one of the most rewarding.  Development is no different, and diving into a new framework/language/technology is incredibly rewarding.

##### Project Focused
- Music is a blank canvas, with endless possibilities. So divining discrete objectives, whether in the studio or the meeting room, was a large part of my job.  I took pride in directing ambitions, reading the market and building campaigns.

##### Attention To Detail
- Ensuring our finished projects were actually finished was the most challenging part of the job, and driving quality control through tight budgets and deadlines is what separated a good album, from a great album.

##### Calm Communicator
- Sleep deprived soundman, prima donna acrobats and neurotic managers are just a few of the types of people you need to keep on side and motivated as a music producer.  Keeping your cool in stressful creative environments, while being open to all opinions I found always brought out the best in people. 

##### Self-Starter
- Nothing happens in music unless you make it happen.  Organising tours/recording schedules/bookkeeping was my day-to-day experience.
